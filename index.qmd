# 👋 Hi, I’m Mahnoor Khalid

I’m a **data analytics professional** with a passion for uncovering insights that inform smarter business decisions.  
Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics** at **Boston University**, where I focus on applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-based data tools to solve real-world business challenges. My academic foundation in **Economics and Marketing** gives me a unique ability to combine analytical thinking with strategic insight.

During my time at **Bayer Crop Science**, I developed **machine learning segmentation models** that generated over **$1 million in profit uplift**, led analytics training for more than 80 employees, and automated SQL-based reporting processes to improve efficiency by **30%**.  
Before that, at **Nestlé**, I optimized supply chain operations, implemented route optimization models that reduced delivery times by **12%**, and built regression-based cost models that cut transport expenses by **9%**. These experiences have shaped my belief that data, when used thoughtfully, can drive transformation at every level of a business.

Beyond professional work, I’ve led and contributed to several analytical initiatives that bridge business and technology. My team won **Boston University’s Fall 2025 ABA Hackathon** for developing a predictive analytics model using U.S. college data — a project that strengthened my appreciation for collaboration, innovation, and the creative side of data science. I also built a **career analytics platform** using Spark, AWS, and Azure to analyze 2024 job market trends, reflecting my enthusiasm for scalable, cloud-based data solutions.

When I’m not exploring datasets, I enjoy learning about emerging analytics technologies, mentoring peers, and designing visual dashboards that make complex data easy to understand. I’m especially passionate about **data storytelling** — translating raw numbers into narratives that inspire strategic action.

If you’re interested in **data analytics, digital transformation, or predictive modeling**, I’d love to connect. Feel free to browse through my projects and CV to learn more about my work and journey.
